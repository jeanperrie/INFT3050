Decided on my web application that I will be coding. This will be based off of the business scenario 1 where the user will be searching for an item within the website in relation to foods and goods at a store selling vegetables and consumer goods. 
The app will have a search function and filter options to help the user navigate more efficiently. The filter can have multiple features added such as the price, type of consumer goods and quantity available for those items. 

Before the next commmit to github, I have decided to at least have a majority of the page elements and UI sorted out as well as some code involved with possibly the way I would create the filter option to users. This is because, it could be the most difficult
and challenging to implement into the app.
